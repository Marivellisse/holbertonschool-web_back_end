# Python - Async

## Description

This project introduces asynchronous programming in Python using the `asyncio` module. You will learn how to define and execute coroutines, manage concurrent execution of asynchronous tasks, and use Python's `random` module within async workflows. The project focuses on understanding the `async` and `await` syntax, creating tasks, and measuring performance in concurrent executions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and apply the following concepts without external references:

- The `async` and `await` syntax in Python
- How to execute an asynchronous program using `asyncio.run()`
- How to run multiple coroutines concurrently
- How to create and manage `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module to simulate asynchronous delays

---

## Requirements

### General

- A `README.md` file is required at the root of the project folder
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**
- All files must:
  - End with a new line
  - Begin with the exact shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - Be executable (`chmod +x`)
  - Contain type annotations for all functions and coroutines
  - Follow the **`pycodestyle`** style guide (version 2.5.x)
  - Be properly documented at module and function level, with complete descriptive sentences

### Documentation Checks

- Module documentation:  
  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- Function documentation:  
  `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
