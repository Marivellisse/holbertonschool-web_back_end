# Python - Variable Annotations

## Description

This project focuses on advanced Python concepts, specifically type annotations introduced in Python 3. It explores how type hints can improve code readability, facilitate debugging, and enable static analysis tools like `mypy` to detect potential issues. Additionally, it introduces the concept of duck typing and demonstrates how to apply it responsibly in a dynamically typed language like Python.

All tasks in this project must follow strict guidelines for documentation, code style, and structure, ensuring that all files are executable, properly typed, and compliant with `pycodestyle` and `mypy`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and apply the following concepts without external references:

- **Type annotations in Python 3**
- **How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types**
- **Duck typing** and how it applies in a statically typed context
- **How to validate your code using `mypy`**

---

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**
- All files must:
  - End with a new line
  - Start with the exact line: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - Be executable (`chmod +x filename.py`)
  - Be properly documented:
    - Module docstring
    - Class docstring
    - Function docstring (for standalone and class methods)
- Code must follow the **`pycodestyle`** style guide (version 2.5)
- Static type checks must be validated with **`mypy`**
- File length will be verified using the `wc` command
