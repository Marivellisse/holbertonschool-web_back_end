# Python - Async Comprehension

## Description

This project focuses on advanced asynchronous programming techniques in Python. It introduces the use of **asynchronous generators**, **async comprehensions**, and **parallel execution** of asynchronous tasks. You will learn to collect values asynchronously, use async for-loops inside comprehensions, and manage concurrent execution using `asyncio.gather`.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Write an **asynchronous generator** using `async def` and `yield`
- Use **async comprehensions** to collect values from async generators
- Type-annotate async generators and comprehensions
- Use `asyncio.gather` to execute multiple coroutines concurrently
- Understand the performance implications of asynchronous execution

---

## Requirements

- A `README.md` file is required at the root of the project folder
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All code must run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.9**
- All files must:
  - Start with the shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
  - End with a new line
  - Be executable (`chmod +x`)
  - Be type-annotated (`AsyncGenerator`, `List`, etc.)
  - Be documented at module and function level with meaningful sentences
  - Comply with `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.x)
  - Pass line length check (`E501` â‰¤ 79 characters)

### Documentation Check Commands

```bash
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
